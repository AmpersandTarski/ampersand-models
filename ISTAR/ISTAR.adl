The 'ISTAR process' is the set of tasks that personnell of 103 ISTAR (and others) have to carry out to support commanders in carrying out their orders. Very roughly speaking, it is the task of 103 ISTAR to provide answers to Intel Requests that such commanders set in order to carry out a specific order in an optimal fashion. That is the scope of this document.-}
