 # Sample config file for Ampersand
 # This file contains a list of all command line options that can be set using a config file
 # It can be used by specifying:  ampersand.exe --config=myConfig.yaml myModel.adl
 # remove the comment character (`#`) in front of the switches you want to activate.
 # Note: Make sure that the minus (`-`) characters are in exactly the same column. Yaml format is picky about that.

switches:
  ### verbose error message format.:
  # - verbose

  ### Allow to build a prototype, even if there are invariants that are being violated. (See https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand/issues/728):
  - ignore-invariant-violations

  ### include a directory into the generated prototype, instead of the default.:
  # - customizations=customizations

  ### Temporary switch to learn about the semantics of crud in interface expressions.:
  - crud-defaults=cRud

  ### tag, branch or SHA of the prototype framework on Github.:
  - prototype-framework-version=development

  ### re-install the prototype framework. This discards any previously installed version.:
  # - force-reinstall-framework
  ### You get the same result by emptying/deleting the directory into which the prototype is generated.
