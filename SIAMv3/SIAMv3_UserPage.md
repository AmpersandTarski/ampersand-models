SIAMv3 User Page
================

The purpose of this chapter is to acquaint people with version 3 
of the Sessions, Identity and Access Management (SIAMv3) module.
It introduces its basic functionalities 
and the ways in which they can be operationalized in an Ampersand script.

The expected audience is a person that knows how to write an Ampersand script,
compile a script into a prototype, and run that prototype. The SIAMv3 module
makes it easy to add Accounts, Roles, people, and organizations to your script.
Also, interfaces are available that allows users to login, logout or register themselves.
