CONTEXT "SIAM-Frontend integration" IN ENGLISH 

{- ----------- LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY ------------- -}
POPULATION devilRole CONTAINS [ ("SYSTEM","SYSTEM") ] -- Role is used in below INTERFACEs and hence needs to be defined in the Role-population
POPULATION devilRole CONTAINS [ ("ExecEngine","ExecEngine") ] -- Default role for ExecEngine

{- Enable/disable built-in login functionality -- see comments in 'localSettings.php'
 * **In 'localSettings.php', the variable 'LOGIN_ENABLED' must be assigned the value 'true'**
 * This requires the following &-INTERFACE defintions:
-} INTERFACE "SessionRoles" FOR SYSTEM : sessionAllowedRoles[SESSION*Role] cRud BOX [ "ignored": I cRud]
{- Notes: 
   1) The name of the interface MUST be 'SessionRoles'
   2) The 'FOR SYSTEM' ensures that the INTERFACE does not show up in a menu.
   3) The expression between the ':' and 'BOX', must provide all pairs (s,r), where r is an activated role in SESSION s.
   4) The SRC-concept of the expression between the ':' and 'BOX' MUST be 'SESSION'
   5) The TGT-concept of that expression between the ':' and 'BOX' MUST be 'Role'
   6) In order to ensure that the concept 'Role' contains all <Rolename>s that are used within the FrontEnd, e.g. for
      - MAINTAINing rules 
      - accessing INTERFACEs
      - using extensions (e.g. ExcelImport, or the ExecEngine API, as specified in the config files):
      you should include statements such as the following, and make sure all <Rolename>s are mentioned:
      ** POPULATION Role CONTAINS [ "<Rolename1>", "<Rolename2>", ... ]**
   7) The text 'BOX [ "ignored": I ]' is not used, so it can be replaced with anything that the parser accepts.  
   8) REPRESENT Role TYPE <something> is not allowed: A 'Role' may not be a scalar (it must be an Object-type)
-}	INTERFACE "SessionAccount" FOR SYSTEM : sessionAccount[SESSION*Account] cRud BOX [ "ignored": I cRud]
