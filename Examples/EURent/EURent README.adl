PURPOSE: To get an idea whether or not, (and if so, how,) the DEMO method of 
     Jan Dietz and the Ampersand method overlap or complement one another. 
     In order to do this, we have created an Ampersand application based on 
     the EU-Rent example given in "DEMO-3 Way of Working.pdf" (this is in 
     the directory "DEMO (Jan Dietz)", which also contains some notational 
     stuff and a link to the DEMO website.)

APPLICATION STATUS: The Ampersand application is found in "EURent.adl" and in
     the files that are INCLUDEd. The application is known to have compiled
     with "Prototype v3.0.1.2964". Work still needs to be done to clean up
     some INTERFACEing issues. The texts needed to create the functional
     specification are good shape, but improvements can always be made...

DEMO SCRIPT: Follow the instructions below to play a bit with the prototype
--[Startup]--
  1) Create the prototype, and run "installer.php" to initialize the
     database with the demo population.
  2) Run the demo ("index.php") which may give some php error messages
     related to sessions (but that's ok)
  3) Refresh until the ExecEngine has computed everything it needs
     (This may need several refreshes).
     Explain what you see in the menubar:
     - 'OVERVIEW' gives some overview of the data in the system
     - 'EU-Rent Website' is where users may request rentals (Internet)
     - 'EU-Rent Branch Office' is the home page of branch offices.
