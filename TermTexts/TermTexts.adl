CONTEXT ShowTermTexts IN ENGLISH
PURPOSE CONTEXT ShowTermTexts
{+This pattern demonstrates the capability of managing variables that are referred to in a Term (specification),
and maintaining an associated so-called 'ShowText' in which the references of variables that have been provided with a value,
are replaced by that value. The purpose of this pattern is to maintain the actuality/validity of such ShowTexts, 
in case Term specifications are being created, updated or deleted, as well as in cases where variables are assigned (updated) values, or such values are deleted.-}
--! Note: this file needs the PHP-function `ParseTermText` to be included as an ExecEngine extension !--

REPRESENT TermText TYPE ALPHANUMERIC
REPRESENT PropertyName TYPE ALPHANUMERIC
REPRESENT VarValue TYPE ALPHANUMERIC

--[Terms]--
critText     :: Term * TermText     [UNI,TOT] -- Text that users specify as Term
critShowText :: Term * TermText     [UNI]     -- as `critText`, with substituted variables

--[Variables]--
varName      :: Variable  * PropertyName [UNI,TOT] -- Label by which a Variable can be identified.
varTerm      :: Variable  * Term              -- Variable is mentioned in Term
varValue     :: Variable  * VarValue     [UNI]     -- Variable has been assigned a VarValue

--[Variable name extraction from Terms-texts]--
{- The idea here is that whenever an Term has a description (TermText), it is parsed to see if it contains names of variables. Such names are surrounded by square brackets (`[` and `]`), and hence can be filtered out. The scope of variables is a Transaction, which means that for every detected variable name in a Term, a variable must exist in the same transaction.
This service ensures that `critVarNames` always contains all names of all Variables that are mentioned in a Term, and does not contain any name of a Variable that is not mentioned.
This service assumes that `critText` is functional, i.e. for every Term, there exists a TermText.
