CONTEXT Scopes IN ENGLISH
{-There are many use cases where all sorts of structured contexts is to be scoped. 
Examples include case-management, judicial cases, a reasoning argument,
the setting up of contracts (transactions), and more.

This module provides a mechanism for supporting such kinds of groupings
This support is based around the concept of `Scope`. 
Basically, a `Scope` is a set of 'structured contents' that we assign some attributes to:
- naming the scope (`scopeID`)
- distinguishing between scopes whose TTexts are templates (define-time) or cases (run-time) (`scopeIsaCasus`)
- documenting the purpose of this grouping (`scopeDescr`)

The structured contents of a Scope can be Atoms of any kind.
Prerequisite for associating such Atoms to a Scope is
the existence of a relation that links such Atoms to a Scope.
An example for `TText`s is the existence of the relation `ttScope`.

--[TText Scopes]--
-- We do not specify (e.g.) IDENT Scopes: Scope(scopeOwner,scopeID) so as to enable other uses, that require a different IDENT 
RELATION scopeID[Scope*ScopeID] [UNI] -- a short name that helps to refer to the Scope
RELATION scopeOwner[Scope*Account] [UNI] -- The Account that is authorized to change and/or delete the Scope. We define it here becuase it is in the IDENT statement, which cannot be updated easily...
--**NOTE that adding/changing relations here below requires adjustment of the ScopeCopying service.**--
RELATION scopeDescr[Scope*ScopeDescr] [UNI] -- descriptive text or purpose of the Scope (may be used e.g. in (popup) helptexts)
