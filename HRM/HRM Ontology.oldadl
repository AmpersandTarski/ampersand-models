CONTEXT EquipmentAssignment IN ENGLISH
PURPOSE CONTEXT EquipmentAssignment
{+The company has decided to keep good track of portable/mobile equipment that has been issued to employees, examples of which are cell-phones, laptops, cars, etc. Doing so allows the company, amongst others, to discontinue subscriptions (e.g. for cell phones), lease contracts (e.g. for cars), licenses (for software on computers), and so on, in a timely manner. Timely discontinuation saves the company more money than using and maintaining a system to manage all this.+}

PURPOSE PATTERN HRM

The reason for assigning this responsibility to the HRM department is that they will be aware of any event where an employee's orgnizational function changes, e.g. in the case of a new employee, termination of employment, or the moving to another department.
