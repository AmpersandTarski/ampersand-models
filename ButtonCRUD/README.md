# ButtonCRUD

The `ButtonCRUD` application serves a number of purposes:

- it is suitable to be used for teaching Ampersand, as it includes
  - nice expressions, e.g. to determine whether there is precisely 1, precisely 2, or more than 2 atoms in a concept.
  - [please expand here]
- it serves as a template for creating, editing, selecting and deleting objects, where the control flow is governed by buttons in the user interface and buttons.
