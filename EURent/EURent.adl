CONTEXT EURent IN ENGLISH
PURPOSE CONTEXT EURent
{+This document specifies automated support for the EU-Rent example as described in 'DEMO-3 Way of Working (version 3, 1 September 2009)' by Jan L.G. Dietz. The purpose of the effort that resulted in this document is to provide case material to support statements regarding the extent that the DEMO approach and the Ampersand approach interfere and/or support one another.

We use the notation 'slide {n}' to refer to a specific slide in the DEMO-3 document mentioned above. In this notation, {n} is the slide number that can be found at the bottom of the slide. We use 'Slide {n},{m}' to refer to slides {n} and {m}.

We use the notation 'P{x}:{y}', to refer to a specific sentence in the EU-Rent description of slide 3. In this notation, {x} identifies the paragraph number, and {y} identifies the sentence in that paragraph. Occasionally, the letter 'a' or 'b' may be appended to indicate the first or second part of (long) sentences. The notation 'P{x}:{y}-{z}' is used to refer to sentences {y} through {z} of paragraph {x}.
