PATTERN BPM -- WIJZIGER: rieks.joosten@tno.nl
PURPOSE PATTERN BPM IN ENGLISH
{+Business Process Managmeent (BPM) is the art of defining 

- result criteria for business processes;
- preconditions for doing the work involved;
- policy/procedural rules that workers should abide by as they do their work.

-}

preCdx :: Process -> Rule PRAGMA "Work within " " can only start if " " is met".
PURPOSE RELATION postCdx IN ENGLISH {+The precondition of a process defines the events that trigger work in this process; every process has precisely one precondition.-}

postCdx :: Process -> Rule PRAGMA "All work done within " " is aimed at fulfilling ".
PURPOSE RELATION postCdx IN ENGLISH {+The postcondition of a process defines the result that the process aims to achieve; every process has precisely one postcondition-}

procedure :: Process * Rule PRAGMA "All work done within " " is expected to comply with " ", or to ensure that this rule is complied with".
PURPOSE RELATION procedure IN ENGLISH {+A procedure is the collection of rules for the uniform processing of cases of 1 kind-}

subProcOf :: Process * Process [ASY] PRAGMA "" " is process that is embedded in ".
RULE "subProcOf is antisymmetric": subProcOf |- -subProcOf~
{- Eens even kijken: stel s=subProcOf
    s |- -s~
<=>      {De Morgan toepassen}
    -(s /\ s~)
<=>      {definitie van |- toepassen}
    -s \/ -s~
Hm, nu eens kijken naar de definitie van Antisymmetrie:
    s /\ s~ |- I
<=>      {definitie van |- toepassen}
    -(s /\ s~) \/ I
Hm, dat is toch wat anders....
-}
subRuleOf :: Rule * Rule [ASY] PRAGMA "" " is an expression contained within ".
RULE "subRuleOf is antisymmetric": subRuleOf |- -subRuleOf~

RULE "results of subprocesses": subProcOf |- postCdx;((procedure \/ postCdx) \/ subProcOf~;preCdx;subRuleOf*)~
PURPOSE RULE "results of subprocesses" IN ENGLISH 
{+Any process that is embedded in a (parent)process has a postcondition that is any one of:

- the postcondition of its parent process;
- a rule that is part of the procedure of its parent process;
- a rule that is part of the postcondition of its parent process

-}

RULE "procedural rules inheritance": subProcOf; procedure |- procedure
PURPOSE RULE "procedural rules inheritance" IN ENGLISH {+Every process shall maintain all procedural rules that are imposed on any of its parent processes-}

PATTERN Cases -- WIJZIGER: rieks.joosten@tno.nl
PURPOSE PATTERN Cases IN ENGLISH
{+Cases are sets of data (each of which is considered an attribute to a specific case). Every case is of a specific type, which also defines the set of data that individual cases consist of. Case attributes may either be data such as integers, texts etc., but they may also be a reference to another case.-}

{-===================================================================-}
-- cases and case types

caseType :: Case -> CaseType PRAGMA "" " is of type ".
belongsto :: CaseAttr -> Case.
belongsto :: CaseAttrType -> CaseType.

RULE "type checking for case attributes": belongsto;caseType = caType;belongsto
{-===================================================================-}
-- nesting of cases
subCaseTypeOf :: CaseType * CaseType PRAGMA "Cases that instantiate " " may contain subcases that instantiate ".
subCaseOf :: Case * Case [ASY] PRAGMA "" " is a subcase (is 'contained' within) ".

RULE "type checking for nested cases": subCaseOf;caseType |- caseType;subCaseTypeOf

{-===================================================================-}
-- Attributes, attribute types, their values and data types
caType :: CaseAttr -> CaseAttrType PRAGMA "" " is an instance of ".
caValue :: CaseAttr * Value [UNI] PRAGMA  "" " has been implicitly (by means of a default value) or explicitly assigned ".
caAssVal :: CaseAttr * Value [UNI] PRAGMA "" " has been explicitly assigned ".

catDatatype :: CaseAttrType -> Datatype PRAGMA "" " specifies that values assigned to its instances must be of type ".
catDefVal :: CaseAttrType * Value [UNI] PRAGMA "Case attributes of type " " will be assigned " " by default".

valType :: Value -> Datatype PRAGMA "" " is an instance of ".

RULE "type checking for values of case attributes": caValue;valType |- caType;catDatatype

RULE "type checking for default values": catDefVal |- catDatatype;valType~

RULE "determine value assignment": caValue = caAssVal \/ (I /\ -(caAssVal;caAssVal~));caType;catDefVal

{-===================================================================-}
-- Rule evaluation (to some degree, that is)

-- Evaluation of rules using non-case-related data
vak :: Rule * Rule [SYM,ASY] PRAGMA "" " has been evaluated to 'TRUE'".
reval :: Rule * Boolean  [UNI] PRAGMA "The result of evaluating " " has led to ".
RULE "Truth of non-case-related rules": vak = I /\ procedure~;procedure /\ reval;'TRUE';reval~
PURPOSE RULE "Truth of non-case-related rules" IN ENGLISH {+Procedures are sets of rules that need to be complied with - period. Therefore, procedural rules may not contain case-related data as this data may not be available (as usually is the case when a new case in a procedure starts). Any rule in which case-related data appears, are to be specified as a precondition and/or postcondition of process(es).-}

-- Evaluation of rules using case-related data
effects :: Process -> CaseType [SUR] PRAGMA "" " operates on cases of type ".
va :: Case * Rule PRAGMA "" " complies with ".
xxxCase :: XXX -> Case.
xxxRule :: XXX -> Rule.
xxxReval:: XXX -> Boolean.
RULE I = xxxCase;xxxCase~ /\ xxxRule;xxxRule~
RULE "Truth of case-related rules": va[Case*Rule] = ((dmenu~ \/ caseType;effects~);(preCdx \/ postCdx);xxxRule~ /\ xxxCase~);(I/\xxxReval;true;xxxReval~);xxxRule
PURPOSE RULE "Truth of case-related rules" IN ENGLISH {+For a specific case, it must be possible to evaluate the pre- and postconditions of every process that either effects cases of similar types, or may appear in menu's of such cases. The reason for this is that this is the condition under which such processes may be activated (see rule [ref]).-}

-- Booleans, since we need them above
true  :: Boolean * Boolean [SYM,ASY] =[ ("TRUE",  "TRUE")  ].
false :: Boolean * Boolean [SYM,ASY] =[ ("FALSE", "FALSE") ].
RULE I[Boolean] = (true /\ -false) \/ (-true /\ false)

{-===================================================================-}
-- Contents of the Process menu window
pmenu :: Process * Process PRAGMA "Als het scherm van " " wordt getoond, dan wordt " " daar in het procesmenu getoond".
RULE "Contents of process menus": pmenu = subProcOf;(I /\ (-procedure!vak);procedure~);(-(dsel;dsel~) \/ dsel; va; preCdx~)
PURPOSE RULE "Contents of process menus" IN ENGLISH {+In a process application, at all times the screen shows a menu (called the pmenu) of processes that can be clicked on (so as to select them for execution). At any particular time, the pmenu shown relates to the process (activity) that is currently being executed/active (called the 'active process'). The contents of this particular pmenu consists of all subprocesses of the active process provided the following conditions are all satisfied:

- all procedural rules of the subprocess must be satisfied. Note that since every procedural rule of the active process is inherited by all of its subprocesses, this implies that if a procedural rule of the active process is not satisfied, then none of its subprocesses will satisfy this condition;
- if a case is selected to be worked on then all preconditions of the subprocess (using data of the selected case) must be satisfied. Note that if no case is selected, every subprocess may appear in the pmenu.
-}

{-===================================================================-}
-- Contents of the Data/Case menu window
dmenu :: Process * Case PRAGMA "Als het scherm van " " wordt getoond, dan wordt " " daar in het dmenu getoond".
RULE "Contents of data menus": dmenu = (I /\ ((-procedure)!vak);procedure~);(effects; caseType~ /\ postCdx;-va~ /\ preCdx;va~)
PURPOSE RULE "Contents of data menus" IN ENGLISH {+In a process application, at all times the screen shows a menu (called the dmenu) of data  elements (entities, cases) that can be clicked on (so as to select them for further processing). At any particular time, the dmenu shows the cases that are relevant to the process (activity) that is currently being executed/active (called the 'active process'). The contents of this particular dmenu consists of all cases for which the following conditions are satisfied:

- all precedural rules for the process have been satisfied. Note that this implies that if a single procedural rule is not satisfied, the dmenu is empty.
- the case is of a type that can be processed by the active process;
- the postcondition of the active process is not satisfied for the case;
- the precondition is satisfied for the case;
-}

-- Contents of the selected Data/Case Window.
dsel :: Process * Case [UNI] PRAGMA "Within " ", " " is selected for further processing".

dselCase :: Case * Case PRAGMA "Whenever " " appears in a dmenu and it is selected by the active process, then " " appears in its submenu".
RULE "Data window contents - cases": dselCase = (-(dsel;dsel~) /\ I)--; moet nog worden afgemaakt a.d.h.v. input van Michiel.
PURPOSE RULE "Data window contents - cases" IN ENGLISH {+In a process application, at any time a case is selected the screen shows a window (called the dwindow) containing the contents of a selected case. Since a case can contain other cases (subcases of the first case), this window shows such subcases. The cases that are shown in the dwindow satisfy the following conditions:

- the case is a subcase of the case that the active process has selected;
- [MOET NOG WORDEN AFGEMAAKT a.d.h.v. INPUT VAN MICHIEL.

dselAttr :: Case * CaseAttr PRAGMA "Whenever " " appears in a dmenu and it is selected by the active process, then " " appears in its submenu".
RULE "Data window contents - attributes": dselAttr = (-(dsel;dsel~) /\ I);belongsto~ --; moet nog worden afgemaakt a.d.h.v. input van Michiel.
PURPOSE RULE "Data window contents - attributes" IN ENGLISH {+In a process application, at any time a case is selected the screen shows a window (called the dwindow) containing the contents of a selected case.
