CONTEXT ScopeIdNamingSvc IN ENGLISH
-----------------------------------------------------------
INCLUDE "Counters.adl"
-----------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE PROCESS "Scope Identification and Naming Service"
{+A multitude of identifiers can be envisaged for Scopes:
- identifiers in every context that is stored somwewhere (i.e. within an IController, or a webserver)
- identifiers for displaying or selecting entities on a screen (in various human Contexts/interfaces)
- identifers for use in operational communication protocols between devices in the real world.
These identifiers should be distinguished amonst one another - they are different (re our Identity Model).
In this Ampersand Context, we only know about:
- identifiers for Scope atoms (i.e.: 'dirty identifiers')
- scopeName, i.e. short texts that can be used to construct (lengthier) identifiers for all sorts of other purposes.
- scopeID, i.e. a long(er) text that identifies a Scope within the context of humans using this system.

PROCESS "Scope Identification and Naming Service"
-- IDs are globally identifiable (within a human Context). Note that within the Ampersand Context, there is no need for such IDs.
scopeID :: Scope * Name [UNI] -- 2.2.2.5 ArtifactId
MEANING "Every Scope may have a Name that is a global identifier"
-- IDENT Scopes: Scope(scopeID)

--[Requesting for the re-computation of global Scope IDs]--

PURPOSE RULE "Request re-identification of Scope if scopeID is not unique"
{+Identifiers must be 'unique', meaning that they refer to no more than one entity (in our case: a Scope). If, within the context where an ID is applied, another Scope has been labeled with the same ID, action should be taken to ensure that such IDs are made different again (or else the ID no longer is 'unique').-}
